# Basic_Calculator
Only one of the four arithmetic operations (i.e., addition) is implemented. Student needs to implement the other three (-,*,/). Also the student has to enable defensive programming. More specifically, think of what could go wrong and implement the code. Focus on the input(s). Test extensively your app. Think and act as an average user. DON'T assume what the user will do, DON'T assume that the user knows what to do. Instead, do what the user COULD do.
